CatLoop

Description: 

Drag and Drop section for the PageLines Framework. 
It allows showing posts from a specific category (category A) in a static page. 
The section can exclude posts in a specific category (category B). This feature was added to allow the exclusion of posts that are in the category of interest (category A but also appear in a Featured category (category B) used for displaying sliders/carousels on the same page as the category posts from category A.  

IMPORTANT: It is not meant to be used in dynamic page templates such as Blog, Category, Archives, etc but in custom templates (Template 1, Template 2, Template 3 ... and user created templates such as page.example.php). 
It has to be pulled in the Content section of the template. 

It will copy the layout set in PageLines>Site Options>Blog and Posts (Magazine or Blog). It will not display a full-width post. 
Only works with regular posts.
