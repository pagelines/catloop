== Description ==

CatLoop allows you to display posts from a specific category in a static page template (Template 1, Template 2, etc. or your own custom page templates). 

You can choose the category you want to display posts from, the number of posts per page, sorting and order, while also being able to exclude posts from another category (i.e. show News, but exclude posts that are in both News and Featured News). 

There is an optional pagination feature. You can use it or you can opt for the pagination in PageLines. 

The layout will be on one column content-wide (Blog Mode) or two columns (Magazine Mode), based on the settings in Blog and Posts. 

NOTE: It will not display full-width posts at the top of the clips in Magazine Mode, only two columns. It works only with regular posts<strong> not with custom post types. </strong>
To use the section, you must place it in the Content area of a static page template (NOT in Blog, Category, Archives, Author, Tag). To learn how to create a new page template for your categories, read this <a href="http://www.anthalis.dk/setting-up-the-stuff-basic-pagelines-theme-and-page-template-creation/" target="_blank">easy tutorial</a>. 

HOW TO USE THE CATLOOP
1. Create a page and assign to it a static template. This static template can be one of the templates pre-defined in PageLines (Template 1, Template 2, and so on) or a template you created. See the link above for a short and easy tutorial on creating your page template. 
2. Go to the drag and drop area of your PageLines settings. 
3. Click on the template in which you want to place the CatLoop in the list of templates. 
4. Click on the Template area. 
5. If it is not already present, drag the Content section in it. 
6. Click on Content. 
7. Drag CatLoop in the Content area. 
8. Go to the edit screen of the page that has this custom template assigned to it. Scroll down to PageLines Meta Settings. 
9. Choose which category to display from the first drop-down menu. 
10. Choose which category to exclude from the second drop-down menu. 
11. Configure how the section will sort your posts and their order.
