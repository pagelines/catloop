== Description ==

CatLoop allows you to display posts from a specific category in a static page template (Template 1, Template 2, etc. or your own custom page templates). 

You can choose the category you want to display posts from, the number of posts per page, sorting and order, while also being able to exclude posts from another category (i.e. show News, but exclude posts that are in both News and Featured News). 

There is an optional pagination feature. You can use it or you can opt for the pagination in PageLines. 

The layout will be on one column content-wide (Blog Mode) or two columns (Magazine Mode), based on the settings in Blog and Posts. 

NOTE: It will not display full-width posts at the top of the clips in Magazine Mode, only two columns. It works only with regular posts<strong> not with custom post types. </strong>
To use the section, you must place it in the Content area of a static page template (NOT in Blog, Category, Archives, Author, Tag). To learn how to create a new page template for your categories, read this <a href="http://catloop.anthalis.info/creating-a-child-theme-and-custom-page-templates/" target="_blank">easy tutorial</a>. 

Works with PL Lite.
